# Masked_Gaussian_Sampler
Hello! These are all the required verilog files which you will require to run a masked gaussian sampler for Falcon scheme. Please note that our sampler (CDT) is only a close approximation for demo purposes. Masking is implemented to mitigate power analysis based side-channel attacks.

I would like to thank our proctor, Mrs. Ashwini V, for guiding us to successfully complete this project.
The team which made these codes and testbench: Bhishma P.S, Chaitanya L., B Bala Aditya and Steephen Raj K.

Here's a note on how to view the output correctly.
